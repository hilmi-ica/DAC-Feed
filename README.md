# DAC of Feed Pump using multi-stage NMPC

This repository contains simulations for degradation-aware control (DAC) of the feed pump using the multi-stage NMPC algorithm, supporting our submission to the IEEE International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation (ICA).

## Purpose

Sharing MATLAB code and data for reproducing results and facilitating review.

## Repository Structure

* **`TestRegime.m`**: MATLAB simulation code for optimization of proof test regime.
* **`FeedMPC.m`**: MATLAB simulation code for DAC of the feed pump using multi-stage NMPC.

## IEEE International Conference on Instrumentation, Control, and Automation Submission

This repository directly supports data and code for our paper submission.
